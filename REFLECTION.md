### What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

I learned how functions like map, filter, and reduce can make things way easier when working with data. At first, they looked kind of confusing, but once I broke them down and added comments, I started to get how they work. It made the code feel less scary and more like something I could actually use in my own projects.

### What was the most confusing part?

The part that tripped me up a little was the uniqueHobbies function. I didnâ€™t really get what the Set thing was doing at first. But after I looked at it and wrote a comment, I realized it was just a way to get rid of duplicates. That helped it click for me.
